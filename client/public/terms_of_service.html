        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Welcome to GearDepo! GearDepo is an online platform designed to connect 
            outdoor enthusiasts with gear owners for the purpose of renting outdoor gear. 
            Before using our website, please read the following terms and conditions carefully. 
            By accessing or using our website, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms. 
            If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our website.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the GearDepo website, you acknowledge that you have read, 
            understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service, as well as any additional terms and 
            conditions that may apply. These terms govern your use of the website and any services 
            provided through the website. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you are 
            not authorized to use our website.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Rental Agreement</h2>
        <p>When you rent gear through GearDepo, you enter into a rental agreement directly 
            with the gear owner. GearDepo acts solely as an intermediary platform to facilitate the 
            rental transaction and does not assume any responsibility or liability for the rental 
            agreement, the condition of the gear, or any disputes that may arise between the gear owner 
            and the renter. GearDepo does not own or control the gear listed on the platform, and therefore, 
            cannot guarantee the availability, quality, or safety of any gear listed.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Gear Listings</h2>
        <p>Gear owners are responsible for creating accurate and detailed listings for their gear 
            on GearDepo, including providing descriptions, images, rental terms, and pricing information. 
            However, GearDepo does not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of gear listings 
            and is not responsible for any inaccuracies, misrepresentations, or errors in listings. Renters 
            are encouraged to review gear listings carefully and communicate directly with gear owners to 
            address any questions or concerns before proceeding with a rental.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Payment and Fees</h2>
        <p>GearDepo facilitates the payment process for gear rentals through third-party payment processors. 
            When you rent gear through GearDepo, you agree to pay the rental fees and any applicable taxes 
            and service fees. GearDepo does not store or process payment information directly and cannot be 
            held liable for any financial transactions conducted between gear owners and renters. All payments 
            are subject to the terms and conditions of the payment processor, and GearDepo is not responsible 
            for any disputes or issues related to payments or fees.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Liability</h2>
        <p>GearDepo assumes no responsibility or liability for any damages, injuries, accidents, losses, 
            or other consequences resulting from the use of rented gear. Gear owners are solely responsible 
            for maintaining their gear in safe and working condition and ensuring that it complies with all 
            applicable laws, regulations, and safety standards. Renters are responsible for using the gear 
            responsibly and in accordance with the rental agreement, as well as any applicable laws and regulations
            . GearDepo strongly encourages all users to exercise caution and good judgment when renting or using outdoor
             gear and to prioritize their safety at all times.
        </p>

        <p>GearDepo operates in compliance with Irish regulations governing online platforms and 
            rental services. However, GearDepo does not guarantee compliance with all local, national, 
            or international laws, regulations, or standards, and users are responsible for ensuring that 
            their use of the website and any rental transactions comply with applicable laws and regulations.
             GearDepo reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate its services or restrict access to 
             its website at any time, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason.
